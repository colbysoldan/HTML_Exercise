        <h1>Colby Soldan</h1>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by! What's there to say?
        I've apparently built my life by hopping back and forth from Texas to Kansas with my husband.
        I've owned around 20 different species of reptiles ranging in size from an inch long viper gecko to a thirteen foot long reticulated python.
        I run Spartan races for fun, but I also crochet.
        I read a LOT of books, and I was a state qualifying Mathlete.
        I am terrible at sports. My volleyball coach told me I made the team "because I was new to Kansas and needed friends."
        My idea of a fun weekend is watching the LOTR extended editions and drinking tea. Bonus points if it's raining outside.
        Oh, and I do computer things.
        Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.
        I will make this better when I have more coffee.

        I looked down at the board. "The <s>point</s> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <s>point</s>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
